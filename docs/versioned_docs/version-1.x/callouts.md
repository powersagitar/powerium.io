# Callouts

Similar to [alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts)
on GitHub, `powerium.io` also supports specially-rendered callout blocks.

These callouts are identified by icons.

- **Info**: _information circle_
- **Tip**: _light bulb_
- **Important**: _megaphone_
- **Warning**: _exclamation triangle_
- **Caution**: _hand_

See [callouts in action](https://www.powerium.io/blog/1805f284-f8a4-80b2-a4fa-d7668f904c2d)
